# EraseNet

This repository is the implementation of EraseNet, a neural network for end-to-end scene text removal.


## Data preparation

The data preparation can be refer to ./examples/. You can download our datatset at [SCUT-EnsText](https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-EnsText) or synthetic dataset [SCUT-Syn](https://github.com/HCIILAB/Scene-Text-Removal) for training and testing. 

SCUT-EnsText needs decompression password, you can send me at [liuchongyu1996@gmail.com](mailto:liuchongyu1996@gmail.com) for it.

## Environment

Anaconda is recommended to establish a virtual environment to run our code. My environment can be refered as follows:
```
python = 3.7
pytorch = 1.3.1
torchvision = 0.4.2
```

## Training

Once the data is well prepared, you can begin training:
```
python train_STE.py --batchSize 4 \
  --dataRoot 'your path' \
  --modelsSavePath 'your path' \
  --logPath 'your path'  \
```

## Testing and evaluation

If you want to predict the results, run:

```
python test_image_STE.py --dataRoot 'your path'  \
            --batchSize 1 \
            --pretrain 'your path' \
            --savePath 'your path'
```

To evaluate the results:
```
python evaluatuion.py --target_path 'results_path' --gt_path 'labels_path'
```

## Acknowledge

The repository is benefit a lot from [LBAM](https://github.com/Vious/LBAM_Pytorch) and [GatedConv](https://github.com/avalonstrel/GatedConvolution_pytorch). Thanks a lot for their excellent work.
